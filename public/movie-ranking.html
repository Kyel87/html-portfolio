<h1>The best movies ever according to Kyel</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dead pool</h3>
<p>Dead pool is is one of my favourite movies of all time. Ryan Renalds is a dream boat and to see him
murdering people in new and creative ways with a twist of comedy is truly captivating. A cinematic master piece.</p>
5 Stars<br />
<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>This movie is every young boys dream. Creating your own suit of armour and being able to take on
    any army easily is something we have all dreamed of doing. </p>
5 stars<br />
<h3>Enemy at the gates</h3>
<p>Easily one of my favourite war films, a true rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish.</p>
